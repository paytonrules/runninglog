* Started with the Tabbed Application Wizard 
- This gives you two view controllers (First View Controller and Second View Controller) 
- Left side will allow you to enter runs
- Right side will let you list past runs
- Simplest storage? (SQL Lite?  A text file?)
- Drawing out a simple "how far did you run" screen.
- Note the duplication in the app delegates.

- Potential "tracking" addition

 ----- What does their app do?, what does our app do? -------
